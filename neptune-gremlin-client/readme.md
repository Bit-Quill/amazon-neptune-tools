# Deprecation Notice

The Gremlin Client for Amazon Neptune has been migrated to a [new standalone repository](https://github.com/aws/neptune-gremlin-client). Ongoing development and releases will take place in the new repository, and this module here will no longer be maintained.

Any Neptune Gremlin Client related issues should be reported in the Issues section under the new repository.

Version 1.1.0 of the client is the last release of the client from this repository. The new repository is accompanied by a release of version 2.0.0 of the Neptune Gremlin Client.

See [Migrating from version 1 of the Neptune Gremlin Client](https://github.com/aws/neptune-gremlin-client#migrating-from-version-1-of-the-neptune-gremlin-client) if you are migrating an application from version 1.x.x of the Neptune Gremlin Client to version 2.x.x.
